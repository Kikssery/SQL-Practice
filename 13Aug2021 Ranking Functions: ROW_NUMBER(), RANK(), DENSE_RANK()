// Ranking Functions
// ROW_NUMBER() always assigns unique numbers, even if two rows' values are the same
// RANK() assigns the same number to rows with identical values, skippin over the next numbers in such cases
// DENSE_RANK() also assigns the same numbers to rows with identical values, but doesn't skip over the next numbers


-- Rank each country's athletes by the count of medals they've earned -- the higher the count, the higher the rank -- without skipping numbers in case of identical values.
