Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+



Wrong Answer:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH Salary_Rank AS (
    SELECT
        Id, Salary, 
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS row_num
    FROM Employee
)

SELECT 
    Salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Salary_Rank 
WHERE row_num = 2;

// No "null"



Solution:

SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;



SELECT
    IFNULL(
      (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
       FROM Employee
       ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1),
    NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary
